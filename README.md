I learned about different HTML elements and how to make HTML forms to collect
user input during this assignment. I was able to create interactive forms that
allow people to enter data since I was familiar with these HTML components. The user
experience was improved by learning about form validation and CSS styling, which made
sure the submitted data was accurate and aesthetically pleasing.
